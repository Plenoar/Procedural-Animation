Drawing with Fourier Transformation 


this is just a repo where i dabble with drawing things by using mathematical equations , i want to mainly focus on the fourier transformation but its
hard to implement 

so far i have added a  program which draws flowers
and also a procedural animation game of life implementation , yipeeeeeeee

for the future ?
-- writing names using fourier 
-- drawing with fourier 
-- anything i find interesting 
-- more interesting procedural animation stuffs
