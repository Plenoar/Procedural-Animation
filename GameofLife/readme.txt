The implementation for the game of life algorithm for cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway, is a mathematical model of self-replicating patterns.


current functions and implementations include the use of some libraries 
- Dear imgui 
- SDL3 

so make sure that you have the dll files for these libs , in case of compilation 


you can use your mouse to put individual cells in any position that you want to , but current implementation paired with high refresh rate realistically only limits the mouse insertion to 1 insertion
so in many cases your cell will die . 

future implementations for this project 
- a multi threaded implementation ( already achieved )
- an ability to pause the time so as to let people insert as much cells as they like 
- ability to change the grid size on whim 
- a color change option 
- ability to change or resize the window 

thats it for now
